Effective Data Augmentation for ML-pipelines. Data augmentation refers to a class of data enrichment techniques for controlling
the generalization error of ML models. Recent works in ML have
focused on devising formal methods for data augmentation. However, most approaches rely on transformation of the data points already present in a seed dataset. A major opportunity is to explore
how the efforts of the database community in data cataloging
and source selection can be applied in the context of data augmentation to improve the quality of the learned ML models.
