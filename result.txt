Effective Data Augmentation for machine learning-pipelines. Data augmentation refers to a class of data enrichment techniques for controlling the generalization error of machine learning models. Recent works in machine learning have focused on devising formal methods for data augmentation. However, most approaches rely on transformation of the data points already present in a seed dataset. A major opportunity is to explore how the efforts of the database community in data cataloging and source selection can be applied in the context of data augmentation to improve the quality of the learned machine learning models.
